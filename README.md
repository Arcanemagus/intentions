Intentions
=========

Intentions is a base package that provides an easy-to-use API to show intentions based in Atom. You can find the API docs in [wiki](https://github.com/steelbrain/intentions/wiki/Provider-API).

#### Usage

The default keybinding for triggering this package is `alt + enter` (or `ctrl + enter` for OSX). If no intentions are available for the current position, no popup is shown.

#### Screenshot

This is how it looks like at the moment. If you are a designer or have a better design in mind, please get in touch
